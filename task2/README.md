# Assignment 2: 
### The task was to build a matrix, and perform several algorithms on it - Especially algorithms related to finding a path between two nodes.
##### Given a matrix, the program will return a different solution for each choice:

* A - Fill the matrix with values
* B - Check if there is a path between two given nodes (cells in the matrix)
* C - Return the shortest path between two given nodes - Based on Floid-Warshall algorithm.
